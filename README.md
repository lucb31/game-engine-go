# Survival game
## Priority
- creeps sometimes still get stuck on the edge of a castle wall

## Open points
- Should the player be able to shoot from within the castle? Or pacified?
- Open: If npc should always move towards player, wps need to be reorderded by distance to player

# Engine

## Damage model
- Add some randomization to demonstrate damage model (might remove / disable later) 

### Optional
- Nr of alive creeps
- Nr of towers

## Projectiles
### Fix
- Put upper limit to nr of projectiles. Might cause problems otherwise

## Towers

### Feat
- Add targetting algorithm: Currently closest to tower
